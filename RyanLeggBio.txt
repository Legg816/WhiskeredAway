My name is Ryan Legg and I am a first year Computer Science major at Drexel University with about 3 years of experience in Python, and some exposure in HTML and Java.  
My goal in this program are to be able to create things that I am happy with and that hopefully benefit others, making advancements in the field along the way. 
I am excited to be able to create and share our game, Whiskered Away.
